# BMI Calculator

This is an app that was written in Flutter (Dart). It is a simple Body Mass Index Calculator for Both children and adults


Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.

For Adults, the app shows the BMI and uses three categories to classify the BMI. These are:
- Overweight
- Normal 
- Underweight

For children and teens between the ages of 2 and 20, the app doesn the same but uses the CDC acclaimed percentile format to classify the BMI into the various categories.
